# Eye-Exercise-Repository

This exercise intends to show case the uses of various Events on DOM elements. The goal here is to trigger the movement of the eye ball with the mouse position on the screen using the mouse events.

**TO RUN THIS:**
1. Clone the code from this repository: https://github.com/ishavankineni/Eye-Exercise-Repository
2. Use index.html to render the program over any prefered web browser.

**Roadmap of future improvements:** This program can be improved by incorporating more mouse events like - click, hover, mousedown, mouseup etc to make the page more responsive.
